# Algorithms
A small selection of algorithms problems I've solved. Unlike Leetcode, Kattis has very consistent and accurate performance metrics, so these are all accompanied by links to leaderboards for that problem, which I'm mostly at the top of (where possible).

##### Get Shorty
Basically Dijkstra's algorithm, though I made some significant optimizations.
